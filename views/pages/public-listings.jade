  h1 About Public Listings
  p When you mark a listing as “Public” on Y2G, it means you are agreeing that this listing is a resource which is public in nature, and includes information which is freely available elsewhere online or in a public forum.
  ul That could include:
    li Community gardens
    li City tool library
    City mulch program
    Public gardening resources
  ul This does not include:
    Private listing
    Any personal property or spaces
    Any gardener listing
  p In addition, if Y2G is contacted by an officiate or owner of that public listing requesting access to modify or delete the listing, they will be given ownership of the listing upon verification.  In the event of disputed ownership, Y2G will remove the listing from the website.
  p You may not under any circumstances create listings with other person’s private information including phone numbers, addresses, or other sensitive information.  If you do so, you are accepting legal responsibility for any legal repercussions.  If your listing is flagged for violation of these terms, you will be banned from Y2G.org.
