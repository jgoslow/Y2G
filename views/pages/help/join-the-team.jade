  h3 For Node.js & MongoDB Developers
  p Please fork <a href="https://github.com/lyradesigns/Y2G" target="_blank">Yards to Gardens</a> on Github.  We welcome submissions of new functionality or tools.

  h3 For Designers and Animators
  p Y2G is just a vehicle to create more gardens in urban environmentsâ€“if you have an idea for how to create more gardens, and want to use Y2G as a platform, we welcome your energies.  We have put together a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q0earhkhutp2qq1/AABv4Mbog7ie1X_nCt7Zt6cIa?dl=0" target="_blank">Dropbox of Materials</a> for you to start from if you want to play around.  If there's something missing you would like access to just shoot a request over to jonas@y2g.org.
  p If you create something for Y2G, we will credit you either in our "credits" section (for visual assets like icons) or on the item itself (as with a photograph).
  ul Some things we would love:
    li Any marketing materials (Posters, flyers, decals, photos)
    li More custom icons (could be anything gardening related, maybe a discussion is in order)
    li Some cool animations (sheep mowing a lawn)
    li Interesting products to spread the word (pins, banners, slogans, google ads)
    li You got an idea?  Send it over!
